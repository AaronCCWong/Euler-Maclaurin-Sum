# Euler Maclaurin Sum
Calculates the Riemann-Zeta Function with arbitrary precision where s = sigma + i * t.

Files currently being modified to include a way to find the zeros of the zeta function.

# Explanation

The following is a brief explanation of how the calculations of the Riemann-Zeta
Function are being done.
